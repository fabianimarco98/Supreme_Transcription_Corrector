# Supreme Transcription Corrector

*Supreme Transcription Corrector* is a Python script designed to enhance the accuracy and readability of transcribed text, particularly subtitle files. The program offers a comprehensive set of features, including the ability to convert text, add, update, and delete word replacements in a conversion dictionary.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to utilize the *Supreme Transcription Corrector*:

1. **Upload Video to YouTube:** Begin by uploading your video to YouTube (or a similar service) while keeping it private. This allows automatic generation of subtitles by the platform.

2. **Download Subtitles:** Once the subtitles are automatically generated by YouTube, download them in the .sbv (SubViewer) format.

3. **Convert Subtitles:** Use a tool to convert the .sbv subtitles to the .txt format for further processing.

4. **Execute the Script:** Run the *Supreme Transcription Corrector* script (Supreme_Transcription_Corrector.py) and provide the path to the downloaded subtitles file as well as the conversion dictionary JSON file.

5. **Customize Corrections:** Follow the prompts to add, update, or delete word replacements in the conversion dictionary as needed to refine the transcription.

6. **Convert Text:** Select the option to convert text and specify the input and output files to apply the corrections to the subtitle text.

7. **Review and Finalize:** Review the corrected subtitle text and make any additional adjustments if required.

8. **Save and Use:** Save the corrected subtitle file and use it with your video content for improved accuracy and readability.
